Connect 4 Game with AI

Overview
This program is a Connect 4 game with a user-friendly graphical interface built using Python's tkinter library. It allows you to play against an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels. The game is designed for two players: the human player and the AI agent.

The AI uses a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make intelligent moves based on the game state and the selected difficulty level.
