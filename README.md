# Connect-4-in-a-Square-vs-AI
Python program that assigns intelligence to an agent playing against a human player in a game of Connect 4 in a Square. Connect 4 in a square is a modification of the regular Connect 4 game; instead of connecting 4 in a straight line, the player attempts to connect 4 in a 2 x 2 square grid.
